# 4. Evaluating our instruction-tuned model

Now that we’ve instruction-tuned our model, we will evaluate it on each of the previously-used benchmarks and try to get a sense of how its performance and behavior might have changed. For fair comparison against our zero-shot baseline, we’ll use the same prompts and generation settings for all of the benchmarks.
