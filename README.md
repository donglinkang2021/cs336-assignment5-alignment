# CS336 Spring 2025 Assignment 5: Alignment

For a full description of the assignment, see the assignment handout at
[cs336_spring2025_assignment5_alignment.pdf](./cs336_spring2025_assignment5_alignment.pdf)

We include a supplemental (and completely optional) assignment on safety alignment, instruction tuning, and RLHF at [cs336_spring2025_assignment5_supplement_safety_rlhf.pdf](./cs336_spring2025_assignment5_supplement_safety_rlhf.pdf)

If you see any issues with the assignment handout or code, please feel free to
raise a GitHub issue or open a pull request with a fix.

## Setup

As in previous assignments, we use `uv` to manage dependencies.

1. Install all packages except `flash-attn`, then all packages (`flash-attn` is weird)
```
uv sync --no-install-package flash-attn
uv sync # if this takes too long, see instructions below to install flash-attn manually

bash get-flash-attn.sh
uv pip install flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.5cxx11abiFALSE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl
uv sync # to make sure everything is installed
```

2. Run unit tests:

``` sh
uv run pytest
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).
