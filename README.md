# CS336 Spring 2025 Assignment 5: Alignment

For a full description of the assignment, see the assignment handout at
[cs336_spring2025_assignment5_alignment.pdf](./cs336_spring2025_assignment5_alignment.pdf)

We include a supplemental (and completely optional) assignment on safety alignment, instruction tuning, and RLHF at [cs336_spring2025_assignment5_supplement_safety_rlhf.pdf](./cs336_spring2025_assignment5_supplement_safety_rlhf.pdf)

If you see any issues with the assignment handout or code, please feel free to
raise a GitHub issue or open a pull request with a fix.

## Setup

As in previous assignments, we use `uv` to manage dependencies.

1. Install all packages except `flash-attn`, then all packages (`flash-attn` is weird)
```
uv sync --no-install-package flash-attn
uv sync # if this takes too long, see instructions below to install flash-attn manually
```

> Update 2025.11.13: Just run after `uv sync`, `uv add flash-attn` is so fast;

2. Run unit tests:

``` sh
uv run pytest
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).

## SFT

Launch the vllm server and SFT on your data:

```bash
bash run_vllm_server.sh
bash run_sft_test.sh
```

To sync the wandb log:

```bash
wandb sync --sync-all wandb/
```
